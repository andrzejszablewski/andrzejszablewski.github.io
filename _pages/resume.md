## Education

MPhil Advanced Computer Science, University of Cambridge
: _October 2024 -- Present_

MEng Computer Science, University College London
: _September 2020 -- June 2024_
: - **First Class Honours** (GPA 4.0 equivalent). Average grade: 80%.

## Research experience

Student Research Assistant, [Natural Language Processing Research Group](https://nlp.cs.ucl.ac.uk/), Department of Computer Science, UCL
: _October 2023 -- Present_
: London, UK
: **Data-Efficient Task Unlearning in Language Models**
: - Applied state-of-the-art optimisation-based machine unlearning methods to improve safety of a 1.3B parameter LLM.
: - Proposed a data-efficient method for unlearning broad capabilities (in contrast to removing specific information present in the training dataset) involving as little as 32 samples of undesired prompt-responses and neutral sample pairs.
: - Currently, scaling up the experiments to 8B parameter models and other tasks.
: **BritLLM**
: - Developed machine translation tool for English LLM benchmarks, and incorporated translated benchmark datasets into the [Language Model Evaluation Harness](https://github.com/britllm/lm-evaluation-harness).
: - Experimented with several hardware and software configurations for 3D parallelism in a multi-GPU distributed environment (_Megatron Core_, _Accelerate DeepSpeed_, _FSDP_, _CUDA_).
: - Our work is publicly available [here](https://llm.org.uk/).

Summer Research Intern, Department of Computer Science, UCL
: _August 2023 -- October 2023_
: London, UK
: - Conducted research on multilinguality of Large Language Models. Assessed the impact of tokenisation algorithms on the performance of multilingual transformer language models.

## Work experience

Software Engineering Intern, gLinux, Google
: _June 2023 -- September 2023_
: Munich, Germany
: - Designed and automated configuration generation for internal software end-to-end release pipelines.
: - Automated the setup of essential permission groups and software deployments to package repositories using the build system and internal CI tools.
: - Technologies used involved _Golang_, _Bazel_ with a significant share of several Google-specific internal projects and tools.

Extreme Blue Intern, IBM
: _June 2022 -- September 2022_
: Hursley, UK
: - Created a proof-of-concept of an immersive AR experience, focused on , supporting achieving client’s goal of 45% circular transactions.
: - Developed a REST API connecting AR application with client's website and a product database.
: - Technologies used included Microsoft _HoloLens_, _C#_, and _Unity_, in the AR platform, and _Python Flask_, _JS_, _Selenium_, and _mongoDB_ in the middleware.

Summer Studentship Intern, UCL
: _July 2021 -- August 2021_
: London, UK
: - Developed a [course on natural language processing (NLP)](https://github.com/TheRootOf3/ucl-nlp-notebook-series) for fellow students.
: - Covered machine learning fundamentals, text pre-processing, NLP classification models and word embeddings.
