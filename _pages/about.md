I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Cambridge.

I’m a Computer Science student at the University of Cambridge.
My interests are in Deep Learning, with a particular focus on Natural Language Processing. In addition, I appreciate the awesome engineering[^1] behind the highly-performant deep learning systems!

Recently, I have been working with researchers from UCL NLP on [BritLLM](https://llm.org.uk/) -- a joint effort towards producing freely available Large[^2] Language Models for UK languages[^3]. In my undergraduate dissertation, I focused on the problem of the poor availability of LLMs for low-resource languages and worked on _language model adaptation methods for African languages_. Currently, I'm working on _Data-Efficient Task Unlearning in LMs_, a method for increasing the safety of language models and removing their undesired capabilities.

### Notes

[^1]: [Awesome Engineering!](https://huggingface.co/blog/bloom-megatron-deepspeed)
[^2]: As of the time of writing (2024-08-27), 3 billion parameters make the model be considered _large_.
[^3]: Isn't this just... English?! Explore [our work](https://llm.org.uk/) to see what other languages are spoken in the UK!
