I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Cambridge. My interests are in Deep Learning, with a particular focus on Natural Language Processing.

Recently, I have been working with researchers from UCL NLP on [BritLLM](https://llm.org.uk/) -- a joint effort towards producing freely available Large[^1] Language Models for UK languages[^2]. In my undergraduate dissertation, I focused on the problem of poor availability of LLMs for low-resource languages and worked on _language model adaptation methods to African languages_. Currently, I'm working on _Data-Efficient Task Unlearning in LMs_, a method increasing safety of language models and removing their undesired capabilities.

Please, don't hesitate to reach out or connect!

### Notes

[^1]: As of the time of writing (2024-08-27), 3 billions of parameters make the model be considered _large_.
[^2]: Isn't this just... English?! Explore [our work](https://llm.org.uk/) to see what other languages are spoken in the UK!
